Working with Python every day, one can get lost quite easily in habits and hide itself into a system that works -yes- but not only could be better, could be easier to manage, more efficient and encourage both creativity and readability. For this first day of 100 days of code, we will setup the poser-IDE: we will introduce, configure ```neovim``` for general Python development and we will do some exercices to start getting used to the workflow associated with the IDE.

## Neovim installation and configuration 
The good thing about installing on Debian-based distros is the magical phrase 

```
sudo apt-get install neovim
```

Another nice thing in the scope of this project is the readily available package for Python development 

```
sudo apt-get install python3-neovim
```

Then we can enter neovim typing ```nvim``` on any shell. Before installing any plugins at the heart of nvim, let's review basic use of the text editor and try to get used to it at least a little bit.
