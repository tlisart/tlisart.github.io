The aim of this 100 days of code is not the usual approach to the challenge, as I do not need to become an amazing programmer at one thing (even though that kind of skills is always welcome). This challenge is structured as follow, every time or day I can learn about a particular concept, technique or improvement in my workflow, I will document it here. As in the original challenge the idea is to create habits in learning elements of computer science, however life takes also place and as I stated, I am not in search of a particular programming job. 

On thos first day I setup and tried some ```neovim``` config. Here are some notes. 

## Neovim installation and configuration 
The good thing about installing on Debian-based distros is the magical phrase 

```
sudo apt-get install neovim
```

Another nice thing in the scope of this project is the readily available package for Python development 

```
sudo apt-get install python3-neovim
```

Then we can enter neovim typing ```nvim``` on any shell. Before installing any plugins at the heart of nvim, let's review basic use of the text editor and try to get used to it at least a little bit. In that case let us do the 30 minutes tutorial included in the nvim editor.
