This page has a really simple aim, it is for me the opportunity to complete the 100daysofcode challenge while keeping track of what I am doing and keeping myself accountable. The reason I am doing this is twofold: first coming from a physics engineering background I learned to program mainly in plain C in the context of numerical analysis courses. While it has its advantages, this knowledge is unfit for industrial development and work (to solve problems and prototype as fast). Second to sharpen quite seriously my flexibility relative to anything related to modern development and especially software design. 

Having programmed in Python, C, Java, Mathlab and LUA, and in the context of my professional settings, it is quite clear that for once going deep in the inner-workings of a particular language and becoming more of an expert can be really valuable (rather than "just" base my understanding on both logic OO and sequencial programming to solve more advanced mathematical problems). It is in that context that I decided to just go learn modern Python in details.

I will roughly be following *Fluent Python* from O'Reiley book for improving syntax and going much deeper into the core features of Python, as I am learning use cases and some framework aspects. I want to profit from this approach to develop my skills even though it might require seeing things I have already worked on and tought about in the past. 

The following question then, preparing some kind of program for myself for the next 100 days, should be broadly speaking devided (being Descartian is the best approach to learn any non-trivial task). So in no particular order here is the coarse idea of a program, which might evolve through time: 

1. Workflow in Python
    - How can I structure a bigger Python program ?
    - What might be the best workflow to write fast and well ?
    - What should be the best practice that I should be implementing all the time ? (those might vary depending on future experience)
    - How can I leverage modern IDE work ?
    - What is a linter ? How do I use this ? 

2. Software development 
    - What are the main software development philosophies ? (should be answered through practice)
    - Building a web scraper 
    - Building a machine-learning workflow 
    - What is database design ? How can I use this properly in my work ? 

3. Frameworks
    - Django
    - Flask 
    - FastAPI
    - etc...
